# SwiftData Journal App Lab

## Introduction
This two-day lab will guide you through building a journal app using SwiftData. Day 1 focuses on getting comfortable with SwiftData basics using a single model. Day 2 introduces relationships and builds the full journal structure.

# Day 1: Basic Entry Management

## Learning Objectives
- Set up SwiftData in a new project
- Create and use a SwiftData model
- Implement basic CRUD operations
- Understand `@Query` and `modelContext`

## Step 1: Project Setup
1. Create a new iOS SwiftUI app called "SwiftDataJournal"
2. **Important**: Check the "Use SwiftData" box
3. This automatically sets up the SwiftData container and imports for you

## Step 2: Create Entry Model
Create `Entry.swift`:
- Use `@Model` class (not struct)
- Include properties: id, title, body, createdAt, updatedAt

## Step 3: Build Entries List View
Replace ContentView to show your entries:
- Use `@Query` to fetch entries automatically
- Display entries in a List with title and relative date
- Add a plus button in the toolbar for creating new entries
- Implement entry deletion with onDelete (use SwiftDataTodoList as a reference)

## Step 4: Add/Edit Entry View
Create a new Swift file called AddEditEntryView for entry creation and editing:
- Use TextField for title and `TextEditor` to input the journal entry message
- Handle both create and edit modes in same view
- **Remember**: Save your modelContext after changes!

## Step 5: Navigation and Polish
- Present the `AddEditEntryView` when the user hits the plus button
- Set up sheet presentation for add/edit
- Remember to save the new entry to the modelContext and save the context
- Test that data persists after app restart

## Day 1 Checkpoint
You should have a working app that can create, edit, delete, and persist journal entries. Test thoroughly before moving to Day 2.

# Day 2: Adding Journals and Relationships

## Learning Objectives
- Understand SwiftData relationships
- Implement one-to-many data patterns
- Build hierarchical navigation

## Brief: Understanding Relationships
SwiftData relationships work differently than simple arrays:
- Use `@Relationship` annotation to define connections
- Specify deleteRule (cascade means deleting parent deletes children)  
- Use inverse relationships to maintain data integrity
- Both sides of relationship need to be defined

## Step 1: Create Journal Model
Create `Journal.swift`:
- Basic properties like Entry but add entries relationship
- Look up `@Relationship(deleteRule: .cascade, inverse: \Entry.journal)`

## Step 2: Update Entry Model
Modify your Entry model:
- Add optional journal property
- This creates the inverse side of the relationship
- Update initializer to accept journal parameter

## Step 3: Build Journals List
Create or modify ContentView for journals:
- Use `@Query` for journals
- Show journal title and entry count
- Add NavigationLink to individual journal views
- Implement journal creation and deletion

## Step 4: Entries View for Specific Journal
Modify EntriesView to use the relationship
- A journal has a relationship to its `entries`
- Let's use that in the EntriesView instead using a @Query
- When you save an entry, make sure to save the entry.journal as the current journal. That's where the relationship is established.
- Update journal's updatedAt timestamp when entries change

## Step 5: Update Navigation Flow
Connect everything together:
- Journals list → Select journal → Entries list → Entry detail
- Ensure new entries are properly associated with their journal
- Test the full navigation flow

## Critical Reminder: Saving Context
SwiftData doesn't automatically save changes. After any create, update, or delete operation:

```swift
func save() {
    try? modelContext.save()
}
```

Call this after all CRUD operations!

## Day 2 Checkpoint
Test your complete app:
1. Create multiple journals
2. Add entries to different journals  
3. Edit and delete both journals and entries
4. Force quit and restart - verify all data persists
5. Check that deleting a journal removes its entries

## Key Takeaways
- Start simple (single model) before adding complexity
- Relationships require setup on both model sides
- Always save your modelContext after changes
- SwiftData handles most persistence automatically once configured
- `@Query` automatically updates your UI when data changes
